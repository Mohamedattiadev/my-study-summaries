# Study Summaries — Obsidian + Excalidraw Vault

Personal CS study summaries: visual notes, diagrams, and book chapters built in
Obsidian with the Excalidraw plugin. Optimized for revision and visual memory
rather than exhaustive textbook coverage.

> Notes evolve over time. Treat as a living document, not a textbook.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> "MY STUDING EXCALI"
```

1. Open Obsidian → **Open folder as vault** → pick the cloned folder.
2. Enable community plugins when Obsidian asks (Restricted Mode → off).
3. Restart. Sidebar should show colored folder names + Lucide icons.
4. **Livesync setup (optional)** — `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-livesync/data.json`
   is gitignored (contains secrets). Configure it locally from the plugin's
   settings panel.

## 🧩 Plugins Included

- `obsidian-excalidraw-plugin` — drawings
- `excalidraw-zoom-wide` — wide-zoom canvas tweak (custom)
- `obsidian-icon-folder` — Lucide icons in file tree
- `templater-obsidian` — note templates
- `obsidian-livesync` — multi-device sync *(needs local secrets)*

CSS theme: **Things** + custom snippets (`ColoredSidebar`, `GeneralTweaks`,
`notebookbg`, `highlighters`).

## 📝 Conventions

- Topic folders use `NN-Name/` numeric prefix → fixes sidebar order.
- Each folder *should* contain an `0000 - <Topic> Index.md` (TODO across most).
- Wikilinks reference notes by filename only (Obsidian resolves path).
- Images live under `90-Assets/`; embed with `![[Pasted Image …png]]`.
