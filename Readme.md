# Study Summaries

This repository contains my personal study summaries and diagrams.
They are created using Excalidraw and organized in Obsidian.
Topics include Operating Systems, Databases, Data Science, Algorithms, and Design Patterns.

The goal of this repository is to visually organize core concepts and support long-term learning.
The notes focus on clarity, structure, and visual understanding rather than full theoretical coverage.
Content may be updated, refined, or expanded over time.

These are personal learning notes, not official documentation.

## How to Use
- Open the notes in Obsidian for best navigation and linking
- Use diagrams as quick references and revision material
- Topics are organized by subject and may grow over time
