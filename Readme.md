# Study Summaries

This repository contains my personal study summaries and diagrams.
They are created using Excalidraw and organized in Obsidian.
Topics include Operating Systems, Databases, Data Science, Algorithms, and Design Patterns.
The notes focus on visual understanding and core concepts.
Content may be updated, improved, or expanded over time.
These are personal learning notes, not official documentation.
More topics may be added in the future.
